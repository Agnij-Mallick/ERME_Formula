Some Rules for anyone trying to merge:

1. Please use the "align" environment for your formulae. If possible, align the equations at the "=" sign.
2. Please be judicious with the use of "align" and "align*" environments. The "align" environment is reserved for any important formulae. Use "align*" when entering a derivation or something similar.
3. Please do not change the document options, namely, [openany, b5paper].
4. Please do not remove anything from the preamble. Additions are welcome.
5. This is an informal README file put together in under 5 minutes. Please refrain from any roasts. Criticism is welcome.
